                    THE OTHERWORLDY AURORA borealis, or northern lights, begin high in Earth's atmosphere -- at
                    altitudes from 60 to more than 250 miles -- when charged particles from the sun become trapped in
                    the Earth's magnetic field. The result is a colorful, dancing light show.

                The first time I filmed an aurora was from an icebreaker near Antarctica. Luckily, there are much more
                accessible places if you'd like to take in these light shows yourself. For the best seats to this
                celestial scene, consider anywhere with a magnetic latitude above 55&#176; and low light pollution. Find
                your magnetic latitude on NOAA and here.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the polar latitudes, aurora can appear on any dark night. Long winter nights are good but not
                necessarily the best time. Near equinoxes in March and September, the Earth's magnetic field lets more
                solar particles interact with the atmosphere, creating aurora seasons! I suggest autumnal equinox in
                September, when there are pleasant temperature in polar latitudes. Find the dark hours of your location
                here, or by using a sky guide app.
