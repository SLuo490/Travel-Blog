                Solheimajökull glacier is a an outlet from the mighty Myrdalsjokull and is surrounded by some of
                Icland's most grand volcanoes and during summertime, a glacier lagoon forms in front of the glacier only
                adding to the charm of the location. This popular day tour is the perfect way to get in real contact
                with the true reason behind the name Ice-land!
